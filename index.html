            <p>Nature has provided us numerous gifts such as air, water, land, sunlight, minerals, plants, and animals.
                All these gifts of nature make our earth a place worth living. Existence on Earth would not be possible
                without any of these.</p>

                        <p>Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the
                            pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities, primarily fossil fuel
                            burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere.</p>

                                little more than 1 degree Celsius, or about 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Between 1880—the year

                        <p>Deforestation refers to the decrease in forest areas across the world that are lost for other
                            uses such as agricultural croplands, urbanization, or mining activities. Greatly accelerated
                            by human activities, deforestation has been negatively affecting natural ecosystems,
                            biodiversity, and the climate. </p>

                            <p>More Than 95% of the forests around the world have dissapeared in just 5 decades! Due to
                                human activities like mining have drastically reduced the number of fertile lands
                                (1,20,00 in India) around the world! Paper has cut over 1,23,0000 forests around the

                            <p>Pollution is the introduction of harmful materials into the environment. These harmful
                                materials are called pollutants. Pollutants can be natural, such as volcanic ash. They
                                can also be created by human activity, such as trash or runoff produced by factories.
                                Pollutants damage the quality of air, water, and land.</p>

                                    In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences estimated that ocean-based sources, such
                                    as cargo ships and cruise liners had dumped 14 billion pounds of garbage into the
                                    ocean!
                                    Over 1 million seabirds and 100,000 sea mammals are killed by pollution every year
                                    and about 5000 every day!
